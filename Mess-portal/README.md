# Mess Portal
A Mess Portal website made on Flask, a microframework in Python.
The Mess Portal allows user to login and add feedbacks to a particular day's food and only admin has access to those feddbacks and he can read those posts.
Additionaly we have integrated a sentiment and funny model that could predict whether a particular review is negative or positive and as well as categorize them into funny or non-funny.
